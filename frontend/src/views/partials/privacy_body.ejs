            <h5>Full Privacy Policy</h5>
            <p>
                Please read this privacy policy carefully before using the services offered by Open Lab, University of Newcastle Upon Tyne (“Open Lab, Newcastle University”, "Open Lab, University of Newcastle Upon Tyne", “we”, “us”).
                We recognise the importance of your privacy. Therefore, we have created this Privacy Policy so that you know how we use and disclose your information when you make it available to us.
                This Privacy Policy applies solely to information collected at this Site. By using or accessing the Site, you signify your agreement to be bound by our Privacy Policy.
            </p>
            <p><b>IF YOU DO NOT AGREE TO THIS PRIVACY POLICY YOU MAY NOT ACCESS OR OTHERWISE USE OUR SITE.</b></p>

            <h5>Personal Information that we collect:</h5>
            <p>
            <p><b>We do not collect or store any personal information from you when you use our services.</b></p>
            <p>
                We are not storing any emails in the system. Even thought we may ask you to enter your email address during logging, to verify that you are belonging to the specific organisation or community.
                We are hashing all emails, before storing them these hashes within system.
            </p>
            <p>
                In other words: Processed them through the function and as the result get the string like <b>ei2di239cji23e2jid230230230c23023d9439gvdfj3</b> instead of the email.
                The thing with the hashes, that they can’t be reverted back to the email.
                So, we are storing this strings instead of the emails, in the system.
            </p>
            <p>
                Every time someone decided to access it, the system hashes the email that was entered by the user at the access page, and then compare given hash with the hashes that are stored in the system.
                if there is a match, the system sends the message to the email that the user just entered in the corresponding form.
                The Service does not retain email address more than that, only for verifying its validity and sending temporary link to it.
                We are not storing emails and we are using users’ immediate input in order to understand where to send an email with the link.
            </p>
            <p>
                Similar thing with the private email. If the user wants to add it instead of work-related one, in the settings he or she needs to enter private email and (as the proof of identity) work email.
                System hashes work email, then check if it has this hash in the DataBase.
                If positive, then hashes private email and send the confirmation link to the work email.
                If it is an actual owner of the work email (has access to it), he or she has to click the link in order to confirm the change.
                And from now on, the additional hash of the non-work email is stored in the system, so the user can enter this additional non-work (private) email during logging, instead of the work one.
